Python package should have all the usual. main.py should execute everything. Have folders for input, output, docker stuff if deemed necessary, src/model, src/utils

Justify decisions, e.g.
  - Naming convention (inc. capitalization)
  - Table structures

  - Python class gets correct subset of df as input // verbosity vs. readability


TO-WRITE:
  - Loader that converts multiple sheets into one dataframe
  - Validator

TAKE NOTE:
"irp_qa_sample_barcode",
"sample_crop",

Clean sheet added to test validator

Mapping as an imperfect solution

Removing NaNs from reference tables

Dropping the "Team" and "Farm" tables
